# 🚀 QitOps Playbook – The Future of AI-Driven QA  

Welcome to the **QitOps Playbook**, an open-source initiative to define the **future of intelligent test automation and AI-powered quality engineering**.  

## **🌟 What is QitOps?**
QitOps is a **modern QA principle** that integrates **AI, automation, and risk-based testing** into the software development lifecycle. It redefines how QA operates by embedding quality at every stage—**intelligent, embedded, and continuous.**  

## **📖 What You'll Find Here**
This playbook serves as a **methodology and framework** for implementing QitOps in real-world projects. It covers:
- **The QitOps Framework** – AI-augmented testing, risk-based automation, and DevOps integration.
- **AI-Driven Testing** – Using AI for test case generation, risk analysis, and defect prediction.
- **Automation Best Practices** – How to build **adaptive, intelligent test automation**.
- **Risk-Based Testing** – Prioritizing tests based on **real business impact**.
- **Enterprise Adoption** – How companies can transition to QitOps.
