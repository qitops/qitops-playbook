# 🚀 QitOps Manifesto

### **We are redefining QA for the AI era.**  
We believe in **intelligent, embedded, continuous** quality engineering.  

### **QitOps Core Principles**
1️⃣ **AI amplifies testers, not replaces them.**  
2️⃣ **Automation should be intelligent, adaptive, and context-aware.**  
3️⃣ **QA is embedded, not a gatekeeper.**  
4️⃣ **Risk-based, data-driven testing guides what matters most.**  
5️⃣ **Quality is continuous, not a final checkpoint.**  
6️⃣ **AI shifts testing left and right—prevention over detection.**  
7️⃣ **Modular, open, and extensible—no vendor lock-in.**  
8️⃣ **AI suggests, humans validate.**  

### **Why QitOps?**
Traditional QA struggles to keep pace with modern software development.  
QitOps redefines how quality engineering fits into Agile & DevOps:  

✅ **AI-Powered Testing** – Automate intelligently, not blindly.  
✅ **Embedded Quality** – QA is a first-class citizen in development.  
✅ **Continuous Risk Analysis** – Test smarter, not just more.  

**QitOps is the future of QA—intelligent, embedded, continuous.**
