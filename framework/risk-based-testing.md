# 🚨 Risk-Based Testing  

QitOps shifts testing from **pass/fail execution** to **impact-driven decision-making**.  

### **🔍 Why Risk-Based?**
✅ **Prioritizes testing based on real-world impact**  
✅ **Reduces unnecessary test execution**  
✅ **Identifies high-risk code areas dynamically**  

### **🔥 AI & Risk-Based Testing**
- **Predicting Defect Areas** → AI analyzes historical failures  
- **Smart Test Prioritization** → AI adjusts execution order  
- **Automated Test Selection** → Reduces redundant tests
