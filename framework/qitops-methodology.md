# ⚡ The QitOps Methodology  

QitOps is an **AI-driven QA methodology** designed to:  
✅ **Enhance automation with AI** (not just execute scripted tests)  
✅ **Embed QA in development workflows** (not gatekeep releases)  
✅ **Prioritize testing based on risk & impact**  

### **🌟 Core Concepts**
1️⃣ **AI-Powered Testing** → Generate, execute, and optimize tests dynamically  
2️⃣ **Continuous Quality** → Shift-left + shift-right testing for full coverage  
3️⃣ **Risk-Based Prioritization** → AI-driven risk assessment before execution
